### About
The main objective is to create a game in assembly and run using the PEPE simulator.

The game consists of shooting at airplanes that are flying at the top of the screen from right to left.
Missils are limited and are fired from a moving cannon at the bottom of the screen. For the cannon doesn't run out of missils it's necessary to hit a box that is in the same place of the airplanes.
For each airplane shot down, the score goes up. The game ends anytime or when there are no more missils.

### How to run:
- Run _Simulador.jar_
- Load the file _Projecto.cmod_ and then click on Simulation
- In the simulator:
  - Double click on Relógio 1 and Relógio 2 then click on Start
  - Double click on PixelScreen, Dezenas, Unidades and Teclado
  - Double click on Pepe and load the file _Projecto.asm_ then click on fast forward button
